# PokeQuiz

PokeQuiz is a command line studying tool that allows you to test your knowledge by answering randomly-generated Pokemon questions. Currently, data from generations 1 â€“ 7 is included, but I do have plans to add generation 8 and *possibly* side-games such as Colosseum and XD Gale of Darkness in later releases.  
  
PokeQuiz ships with a lightweight SQLite database containing information on:
- Pokemon
- Regions (Kanto, Johto, etc.)
- Towns
- Gym Leaders
- Enemy Teams (Rocket, Magma, etc.)
- Games (Red & Blue, Silver & Gold, etc.)



## Installation
To install via pip, go to your terminal and run:
```cmd
> pip install pokequiz
```

To install from source, download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Dechrissen/PokeQuiz/releases). Make sure to `cd` into the directory of the source files and and run:
```cmd
> python setup.py install
```

## Usage
Installing PokeQuiz will add an entry point to your PATH named `pokequiz`.  
  
To run PokeQuiz from your terminal, simply run:
```cmd
> pokequiz
```
or
```cmd
> python -m pokequiz
```
