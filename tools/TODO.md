# TODO

- passwords / easter eggs
- special seeds for gen 1 only, 50 q, etc.
- congratulate with question streaks and delayed one line printing
- add args to pokequiz command line (e.g. `pokequiz -s 55` for seed 55 from terminal, `pokequiz -m` for marathon mode) from stackoverflow link about entry points
- fossil questions (e.g. what Pokemon comes from Root Fossil?)
- when you enter generations to exclude, empty `excluded` list first
- exit marathon mode prematurely and still display score (for normal quizzes too)
- time attack mode
- add trial captains from alola
- add gen 8 data
- add spin-off game region data (colo, XD)
- move questions
