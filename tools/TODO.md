# TODO

- user profiles and high scores?
- passwords / easter eggs
- special seeds for gen 1 only, 50 q, etc.
- congratulate with question streaks and delayed one line printing
- add args to pokequiz command line (e.g. `pokequiz -s 55` for seed 55 from terminal, `pokequiz -m` for marathon mode) from stackoverflow link about entry points
- fossil questions (e.g. what Pokemon comes from Root Fossil?)
- when you enter generations to exclude, empty `excluded` list first
