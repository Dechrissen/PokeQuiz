# TODO

- create reference chart somewhere with question categories (RegionQuestion, PokemonQuestion, etc.) and their types (1, 2, etc.)
- seed generator, challenge others to the same seed to compare scores
- mainMenu() function that is called at the start of the program, asks for user selection/options, and is called again after every quiz
